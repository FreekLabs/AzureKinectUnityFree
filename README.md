# AzureKinectUnityFree
Azure Kinect Examples for Unity (free version)

## Introduction

This is the free version of 'Azure Kinect Examples for Unity' package. It contains two demo scenes so far:
* BasicColorDepthDemo - shows the basic sensor streams
* VfxPointCloudDemo - shows the point cloud of the environment.

It's not much, but you can get the feeling what the full package looks like.
Enjoy!
